bashscripts
===========

USE THESE SCRIPTS AT YOUR OWN RISK. I DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY THEM OR YOUR USE OF THEM.

A series of various bash scripts I've written over the years while as an IT admin at With A Twist Studio.  I had to automate quite a bit behind the scnenes of our production department.  Using Bash + crontab, among other languages, really helped my life as an admin.  Then I was able to spend more time doing what I really enjoyed, pipeline development for vfx.

There are only a few scripts here so far, but I'll be adding to the list.  I haven't run these in a while, so feel free to contact me if you have any questions, etc.
